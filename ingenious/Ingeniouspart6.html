				<h1>Alice</h1>
			</div>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Away from my brother you vixen!&#8221; I held onto Ene&#8217;s arm tightly while Kari held onto his other arm as we walked down the hall. My eyes were dark like my brother&#8217;s. My hair was tied into a long ponytail reaching halfway down my back. I wore an indigo skirt and jacket with a gold shirt underneath.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;You&#8217;re such a brat.&#8221; Kari complained.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Hey, don&#8217;t insult my sister.&#8221; Ene told her. I stuck out my tongue at Kari.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Ugh, when do you two get your memories back? Dealing with the young you two is a pain.&#8221; Kari groaned.
			</p>
			<p>
			    One of the doors nearby opened, &#8220;Ene?&#8221; A young girl called my brother&#8217;s name from the doorway. She had long pink hair and red eyes. She
			    wore black headphones in contrast to my brother&#8217;s white ones. She wore a white sundress and held onto a tan sun hat with a white ribbon in her left
			    hand. her headphones were lowered down to her neck like my brother wore his.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s me.&#8221; Ene answered.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;I didn&#8217;t see you, so I thought you left me like the others.&#8221; She walked forward quickly and hugged Ene, &#8220;But you
			    didn&#8217;t.&#8221; The girl looked up with tears in her eyes and smiled. &#8220;And you too Alice.&#8221; She hugged me. She spoke mostly monotonously,
			    barely showing her emotions.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Hey, what are you doing?&#8221; I yelled and pushed her away.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry, I guess a hug was too much.&#8221; She apologized.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Who are you? You&#8217;re not after my brother too, are you?&#8221; I glared at her.
			</p>
			<p>
			    She seemed confused. &#8220;Alice, you don&#8217;t remember me?&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; I asked again.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;You don&#8217;t know me.&#8221; She sounded upset. &#8220;How about you Ene? Do you remember me?&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;No.&#8221; He answered.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;You all have amnesia. You&#8217;re at different points in your lives, you&#8217;ll catch up eventually.&#8221; Kari said. &#8220;Come on let&#8217;s
			    go.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
			    Cerebellum grabbed onto Ene&#8217;s arm, but let go when we looked at her. &#8220;Sorry, it&#8217;s a habit.&#8221; She said. The four of us kept walking
			    until we entered a room with several people waiting for us.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Welcome!&#8221; One of the boys said. &#8220;What&#8217;s with that look?&#8221; He stared at me then chuckled, &#8220;So only K and I have our
			    memories. Z and R have some just not all though.&#8221; This prompted everyone to introduce themselves. The girl who hugged me earlier was Cerebellum.
			    &#8220;Where is N anyway?&#8221; James said after a few moments
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;I really couldn&#8217;t care less. That kid&#8217;s so narcissistic he&#8217;s annoying.&#8221; Kari complained.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Knowing N, he&#8217;ll be at the top of the building doing his superiority act again.&#8221; James said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Should we wait for him to come down or are we going up to meet him?&#8221; Zane asked.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Cerebellum&#8217;s stomach started to rumble. &#8220;I&#8217;m hungry.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;We should get something to eat.&#8221; James laughed.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;I&#8217;ll take you to the cafeteria. I&#8217;m General Noel, nice to meet you all.&#8221; A man said. He had short dark hair and he wore a long
			    sleeved white jacket and dark gray pants both of which had many pockets. We sat down at a cafeteria table downstairs. The walls were knocked down in order
			    to make room for many people.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;So are all of them soldiers?&#8221; Zane asked.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;A bit over half of them are soldiers. The rest do other things such as clean and cook, but everyone here is part of the resistance we&#8217;ve been
			    building.&#8221; Noel answered.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Hello there.&#8221; A boy said. He wore a white coat with a gold outline. His eyes were blue and his hair was blond. &#8220;You&#8217;re rather
			    beautiful you know, to catch my eyes is an astounding feat. You shall become my girlfriend.&#8221; He smiled and held out his hand to the vixen holding my
			    brother.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Sit down N, I still don&#8217;t like you.&#8221; Kari spoke to him with disgust.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;N? Do you mean to refer to me? I have to say you have a detestable attitude, I&#8217;ll need to get rid of that.&#8221; N grinned as he sat.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Same as ever I see.&#8221; James laughed, &#8220;Nazaria, you may have forgotten, but we&#8217;re all good friends. Don&#8217;t be so angry when we
			    call you N.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;You should not be speaking to me with such familiarity even if we were good friends.&#8221; Nazaria said condescendingly.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;This guy seems like a total weirdo.&#8221; I said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Watch your mouth young lady.&#8221; Nazaria moved his hand to karate chop me on the head, but Ene grabbed his arm. &#8220;Ow that hurts you
			    degenerate! Unhand me!&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;If you try to lay a finger on my sister again I will hunt you down, I will reach into your chest and pull out your heart.&#8221; Ene said calmly,
			    but you could feel wrath seething from him. He finally let go of Nazaria&#8217;s arm and pet me. I leaned on him and smiled.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Haha, I will reach into your chest and pull out your heart, do you remember who told you that?&#8221; Kari laughed.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;I can&#8217;t remember really.&#8221; Ene answered.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;It was me, after our first date. If you break up with me I will hunt you down, I will reach into your chest and pull out your heart.&#8221; She
			    laughed.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;You on a date with my brother? Ha, I would never allow such a thing.&#8221; I laughed at her.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Well it did happen.&#8221; Kari smirk.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;You would never leave me, right brother? Not for another woman like her.&#8221; I said in my best pleading voice looking up at him with extra water
			    in my eyes to make it seem as if I was about to cry.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Of course not, everything is this world is yours and that includes me.&#8221; Ene pet me as I smirked at Kari. My brother Ene isn&#8217;t very good
			    at understanding emotions. He can only understand logic and extreme emotions such as rage or my pretending to cry, but he can&#8217;t pick up on the
			    pretending part. &#8220;Alice, do you know what my phone password is?&#8221; Ene handed me his phone. I typed in a few passwords from some of his games,
			    but none seemed to work. I looked back at him and shook my head.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;684,137,218&#8221; Kari said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Voice command accepted.&#8221; A programmed voice answered. &#8220;ID 1782 Kari&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Transfer authority to ID 350 Ene.&#8221; Kari said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Transfer complete. New message set to auto-start, answer the following question: are your memories intact?&#8221; The voice said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Um, no?&#8221; Ene answered.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Hello there idiot!&#8221; A hologram of Ene came out of the phone, &#8220;I understand that you&#8217;ve lost your memory like the main character we
			    are. Good job, pat yourself on the back. Now then I don&#8217;t exactly know how much of your memories are still there, but for precaution let&#8217;s just
			    start at before you met Cere. When you were seven you went grocery shopping with Alice and stopped by the arcade that just opened up. During a rigged
			    shooting game Cere entered in as player two and helped win the game without an extra token being spent. We invited Cere to live with us after we found out
			    she was an orphan and a genius. She was a bit timid and cling to us often for the first two years. We met M online. Then we got picked up by truancy and
			    met Kari after she had beat some idiots up. Kari and you then were enrolled in the same school where we met J. Z and R were met a year later on the
			    streets. Enma disappeared on November Eleventh 2050, then Kagerou precisely one year later. N tried to pick up Kari, but she turned him down. After three
			    more years a blood-transmitted zombie enhancing virus was released. After we analyzed it, special thanks to Rosemary on the chemistry, we used it on
			    ourselves, but had to go into cryostasis or else we would&#8217;ve died from shock. Oh, I forgot to mention that Cere invented a gravity control device
			    then 25 cores which would be used to make arks which you should be floating on now. Thus ends our recap.&#8221; The hologram went away.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you sent yourself a recap. Why didn&#8217;t I do that?&#8221; James said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Why wasn&#8217;t our date in there?&#8221; Kari hit my brother.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;I don&#8217;t know I didn&#8217;t make it.&#8221; Ene complained as he rubbed his arm.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Yes you did!&#8221; She tried to punch him again, but he blocked it.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Well I don&#8217;t remember it so it&#8217;s like a different person.&#8221; Ene said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Memories are the largest determinant of a person.&#8221; Cerebellum said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; Ene said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;This phone will self-destruct in three seconds.&#8221; A hologram of a bomb appeared out of the phone with a large three above it.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Why the hell did I rig this?&#8221; Ene threw his phone at the wall and shielded me.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Get down!&#8221; Noel yelled. Everyone jumped under the tables and waited for the explosion.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Hahaha,&#8221; Ene&#8217;s voice could be heard from the phone, &#8220;That&#8217;ll be funny when we get there. I wish I could&#8217;ve seen my
			    face.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Guess I didn&#8217;t rig it.&#8221; Ene grabbed his phone from the other side.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;You would do something like that.&#8221; Our group started laughing.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Hey we&#8217;ve got a problem.&#8221; A woman came over to us.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; I asked.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;I am Colonel Trist Tania.&#8221; The woman replied, &#8220;Again, we have a problem. The higher-ups just messaged me, I am to take you all into
			    custody.&#8221; She said showing us the message on her phone.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Well you just died.&#8221; Ene grabbed her phone and smashed it.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;What&#8217;d you do that for!&#8221; Trist slammed the table as she got up.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Sit down and stop yelling, we can hear you just fine.&#8221; Ene commanded with a sigh.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;We can&#8217;t have them tracking you and tapping your phone idiot. Try using your head.&#8221; Kari smiled.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;With you guys we can finally take down the government. When I became a general I was informed about all the experiments President Reese has
			    conducted. He&#8217;s been observing and experimenting on those who come back from the surface and survived with wounds from those monsters. The five
			    missing graviton cores were used in experiments as well.&#8221; Noel said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;What should we do first?&#8221; Rosemary and Zane turned to Ene.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;How am I supposed to know?&#8221; Ene asked.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;I think our first move should be to get Quantitative System Frontier Records.&#8221; James said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; I asked them.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;QSFR is just a fancy name we gave the super computer we built. It&#8217;s sort of special. Your brother, K, and C were able to program it so it
			    could collect any and all digital information, non-dependent of how it connects as long as it does connect to anything. You guys made the ultimate
			    self-hacking machine.&#8221; James explained.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &#8220;Even for people like us it&#8217;ll take a while to run through all the information of the last thirty years.&#8221; Kari stretched,
			    &#8220;Let&#8217;s get going. It&#8217;s under the seventh island where you woke up Ene.&#8221;
