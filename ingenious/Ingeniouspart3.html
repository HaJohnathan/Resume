			<p>&ldquo;Ow my head.&rdquo; I sat up. I had apparently been lying in bed up until now. The room was rather large; it seemed like a room of a rich young lady like you would see in an anime.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;About time you woke up, I&#39;ve been so bored!&rdquo; Ishiza yelled.</p>
			<p> &ldquo;I&#39;m bored too.&rdquo; Noda was standing by the window.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I got food.&rdquo; Airi walked in with a smile. Airi was the last of the triplets. She had pink hair and emerald green eyes. She wore a light blue unzipped long sleeved shirt over a white shirt and a white skirt. She had eyes filled with wonder and always smiles. She&#39;s the nicest of the three. She brought me a bowl of food.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; I said quickly devouring what she had given me. She took the bowl after I finished and left with the other two. I hopped out of bed and walked toward the window. The city that I was in was made of many gray buildings. I looked around the city from the window studying everything. There was something very odd about this city; there was no grass for farmers to work on, nor were there factories shooting plumes of disgusting gasses into the air. But what was the most peculiar about the city was the wall at the edge. It seemed like something you would have seen on TV or in a game. I estimated the wall to be about forty feet tall. There were two openings that allowed a monorail line to run through it.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Oh good you&#39;re up.&rdquo; Trist opened the door after a short knock. &ldquo;Are you feeling alright? You gave us quite a scare when you fainted like that.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I&#39;m fine, everything&#39;s a bit loud though.&rdquo; I answered.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;You know your senses are enhanced, right? Or do you not remember that?&rdquo; She asked.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;No, I seem to be missing a lot of my memories.&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;When is this?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The year is 2084. That makes you 46 now.&rdquo; She said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; I asked another question.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This is the 5<sup>th</sup> island, reserved for military units.&rdquo; She answered.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;You&#39;re going to explain everything to me.&rdquo; I told her.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I was planning on it.&rdquo; She said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I&#39;ll have to get Airi, Ishiza, and Noda first.&rdquo; I said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&#39;s fine.&rdquo; A boy opened the door further. He was wearing a dark gray long sleeved shirt with no design on it and tan pants. He had brown hair and blue eyes. &ldquo;I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll catch up.&rdquo; He smiled, but stopped soon after. &ldquo;You don&#39;t remember me, do you?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Not really. You look familiar, but I can&#39;t remember.&rdquo; I answered.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;James, call me J. Do you remember the others that were in cryogenic freezing with us?&rdquo; He asked.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Specify.&rdquo; I commanded.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Kari.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;She&#39;s got eidetic memory and she&#39;s bossy. If you ask her to explain something she&#39;ll ask you if you&#39;re stupid.&rdquo; I said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Yeah that sums her up.&rdquo; He smiled to himself. &ldquo;Rose and Zane.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Something about dependency, but that&#39;s all I got.&rdquo; I was trying to think.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;How about Sarah?&rdquo; He grinned.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Sarah, something, someone important.&rdquo; I said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Even without them.&rdquo; He grinned and said to himself.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Nothing, you remember Alice right?&rdquo; He asked.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Of course I remember her, she&#39;s my sister. She went under with us, right? Where is she?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We weren&#39;t able to retrieve her; the rebels took her.&rdquo; Trist said.</p>
			<p> &ldquo;Incompetence at its finest.&rdquo; I said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I don&#39;t have super hearing, but I can hear that.&rdquo; Trist snapped.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;You still have your way with words I see.&rdquo; James laughed. &ldquo;So other then E and I, who else is here?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Rosemary and Zane are here, this way.&rdquo; We followed Trist down the hall. &ldquo;Excuse me.&rdquo; Trist knocked on the door and opened it slowly. &ldquo;You guys awake?&rdquo; She said. Suddenly the door broke off its hinges and crashed into the wall. When all the dust cleared a girl was holding Trist&#39;s knife against her neck and a boy was looking at the hole in the wall.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;How did you do that?&rdquo; Zane said. He wore a long sleeved light blue collared shirt and black pants. His hair was black and his eyes were brown.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I don&#39;t know, I just kicked it.&rdquo; Rosemary said. She wore a white shirt and a green shorts. She had long blond hair and blue eyes. Her breasts were a bit larger than average. &ldquo;Anyway, I demand to know where we are and what are we doing here!&rdquo; She yelled at us, &ldquo;J, E what&#39;s going on here?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Cryogenic freezing, some memory loss was expected.&rdquo; James said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Why were we frozen?&rdquo; Zane asked.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&#39;s a lot to explain, so let go of Trist and we&#39;ll go somewhere.&rdquo; James answered. Rosemary let go of Trist as I walked towards the other door. I slammed
			    my fist against its side and broke it off its hinges and through the wall.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Wow, that&#39;s cool.&rdquo; I said to myself.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Stop breaking things! We don&#39;t have as many resources as we did in your time!&rdquo; Trist yelled at us.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;It was just test.&rdquo; I said under my breath, &ldquo;Come on let&#39;s go.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Well let&#39;s see.&rdquo; Trist sat us down in a lounge.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;The current year is 2084 and we went to sleep 30 years ago. A zombie-like pandemic broke out and turned people into mindless monsters with enhanced
			    abilities. We were able to analyze the virus and use it to our advantage. We infected ourselves and went into a 50-year sleep while the virus changed all
			    of our cells. Then after that I don&#39;t know anything.&rdquo; James made a quick explanation.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;A few years after you all went under, a new strain of the virus arose. The original virus, known as seminabis, was blood transmitted while the new strain
			    was transmitted by any bodily fluids. The worst part was that it was as if the new strain was trying to kill us off. The ones infected by the original just
			    rampaged about and killed anything in sight, but the new one attacked specifically humans, then spread the disease. They didn&#39;t kill anyone.&rdquo; Trist
			    explained.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Interesting story, I assume that the population is now extremely small and insurgents thought it was time for us to wake up and save the world.&rdquo; I said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Yes, but the only problem is that no one was supposed to know about you. In the history books you are all written off as disappearing like the other three
			    geniuses.&rdquo; Trist said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Who were the three that disappeared?&rdquo; Zane asked.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;It was-,&rdquo; Trist started to say.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Kagerou, Enma, and Mikhail.&rdquo; James cut her off.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Kagerou and Enma are gone? That&#39;s a real disappointment. They made the best games.&rdquo; I sighed. &ldquo;What am I going to do now? I think I&#39;ll just go shoot
			    myself outside.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;You&#39;ll get over it, you did last time.&rdquo; James said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Whatever.&rdquo; I answered with another sigh as I learned back on the couch.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Where are we right now?&rdquo; Zane asked.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;This is the 5<sup>th</sup> island, reserved for military units.&rdquo; Trist answered.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Where are the islands you idiot?&rdquo; I said. I could feel her rolling her eyes at me.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;In the air, when we were human we created 30 large-scale gravity cores. The gravity cores were made with enough energy to keep a city in the air for a
			    little over a century.&rdquo; James explained
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;30? There are only 25 islands though.&rdquo; Trist said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;25 islands,&rdquo; James repeated, &ldquo;no that&#39;s wrong. Something&#39;s wrong here. Don&#39;t report our rescue to the higher ups.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;I already told them.&rdquo; Trist said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;That&#39;s unfortunate.&rdquo; James crossed his arms, &ldquo;What&#39;s done is done, we need to find the rest of our group.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Sounds good,&rdquo; I sat up and smirked, &ldquo;I want to see my sister again. What are your abilities? I need to know how to use you guys.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll coordinate everyone.&rdquo; James said. &ldquo;For now.&rdquo;
