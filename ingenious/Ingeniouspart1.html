			<p>&ldquo;Manual Override Successful, Program Initializing.&rdquo; A computer spoke with a female&#39;s tone of voice. The words were also printed in green lettering on the screen in front of me. The green lettering was the only thing providing me with light in this small enclosed space. The words soon disappeared and the wall they were on opened suddenly. The light blinded and left me dizzy for several moments. The room I was standing in had a white tiled floor and ceiling while the walls were made of mirrors. I could see that I had long black hair for a boy; it was covered everything above my left eye. My eyes happened to be black as well. I was wearing an unzipped dark blue hoodie with black jeans and a red shirt. On my head I wore sunglasses with connected lenses. I also wore a pair of white headphones around my neck. The phone they were connected to was out of battery so no music could be heard. I was about sixteen years old, for some reason I couldn&#39;t remember everything correctly. A bunch of it seemed to be a blur.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Come on, this way!&rdquo; A young girl happily yelled as she pointed to the dark hallway that had opened up through the mirrors in front of me. The young girl had long red hair and dark eyes. She wore a dark red shirt and a black skirt.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Ishiza?&rdquo; I said to myself. &ldquo;Yes, that&#39;s your name.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Come on you idiot, let&#39;s go, go, go!&rdquo; She shouted. She was obviously bored and curious, and I can&#39;t say I wasn&#39;t too. I followed her down the dark hallway for a minute or so. The next room had a checkered floor and a red carpet that led to a balcony. Below me was a giant chess board. On the other side of the room was a giant monitor that read &ldquo;Defeat the program and move on. Level: Super Grandmaster.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Chess?&rdquo; I said to myself, &ldquo;Pawn D2 to D4!&rdquo; I called out. The pawn moved just as I assumed it would. I tried my best to ignore anything that Ishiza did, which included random screaming, running around, and jumping, and focused on the game. Any pieces that were captured descended into the floor then the panel would re-ascend without the piece. &ldquo;Rook E1 to E7, Checkmate!&rdquo; I called out. The railing in front of me lowered and a bridge connected the balcony to a door that had just opened. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;Let&#39;s go.&rdquo; Noda said as she walked forward, calmly and confidently. Noda was one of the triplets and so she looked much like Ishiza, but she had blue hair and blue eyes that seemed to be looking either objectively at everything or right through it. She wore a dark blue shirt and a gray skirt. Whereas Ishiza had a gleeful expression most of the time, Noda had one that said she was bored, tired, and disgusted at everything.</p>
			<p>The next room was down a hallway that was just as long as the last. When I reached the end I saw several people pinned up to the walls with several more bodies on the floor in puddles of blood. Four people with rifles quickly surrounded me. &ldquo;Against the wall! Hands in the air, now!&rdquo; I took several seconds to analyze the situation. I didn&#39;t recognize the soldiers&#39; uniforms or the weapon models. I have no way of understanding the variables, no way to calculate everything and find the answer to get out of the situation. I simply did as I was told and I was about to comply with their orders when a woman spoke up.</p>
			<p> &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; She pushed her way to the front. She had long purple hair and purple eyes. She wore a black long sleeved shirt and pants. &ldquo;You&#39;re Ene, aren&#39;t you?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Do I know you?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;No, I&#39;m twenty-three now so there isn&#39;t any possible way you could know who I am. I&#39;m a bit too young for you. I am Colonel Trist Tania, it&#39;s nice to finally meet you.&rdquo; The girl held out her hand.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Exactly what is happening?&rdquo; I asked looking around.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Well, I was told you might have some memory loss.&rdquo; She said taking he hand back. Her voice seemed to become much deeper and slower when she said the words &ldquo;memory loss&rdquo;. She kept speaking, but her mouth moved slower and slower. I couldn&#39;t put together what she was saying. I was getting headache from this. Suddenly my vision started to zoom in and out as if I was looking through a telescoping then taking it away quickly, or maybe more like a camera lens, either way it was making this headache much worse. I could feel myself lean one side then the other slowly. I put my hands to my temples and closed my eyes as I shook my head.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Trist put her hand on my shoulder, &ldquo;are you okay?&rdquo; She shouted louder than she should&#39;ve been able to. It was like a blast of sound coming from a loud speaker at maximum volume. That was it, I was done. Everything just went dark.</p>
