			<p>&ldquo;Manual Override Successful, Program Initializing.&rdquo; A computerized feminine voice said. The words also appeared in green lettering on the screen in front of me. The screen went dark and opened. The room I now stood in was filled with mirror walls and a white tiled ceiling and floor.</p>
			<p>I had long silky white hair that reached my butt. My eyes were light blue. I wore a red and black checkered long shirt and dark blue pants. I walked forward to the door that would open seconds from now. My ear twitched when the opening doors let in the sound of gun fire in the distance. I&#39;m not used to the enhanced senses so I can&#39;t tell how far, but it&#39;s most likely at the control center. I ran down the long hallway to my testing room. In my testing room the monitor had a long math equation with a 30 second timer.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;They should&#39;ve made this harder.&rdquo; I sighed as I calculated the answer instantly. I wrote the answer with my finger. The monitor tuned off and split apart to show the next hallway. As I ran towards the control center the gun shots got louder, mostly, and my head started to pound. It wasn&#39;t just the noise that was giving me a headache, it was everything about my new body; the enhanced eyesight kept going out of control, the noise would randomly get louder and softer, I would randomly use too my strength in my steps making it uneven, and the worst part was the time distortion I felt. If you were to move faster, time moves relatively slower since time is only in a person&#39;s head. All of it was making me sick so I stopped for a moment.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, are you Master Kari?&rdquo; A soldier put his hand on my shoulder while I was trying to control my senses.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Don&#39;t touch me!&rdquo; I grabbed his hand and pulled it off my shoulder. I used to my strength in my grip and heard the bones in his arm crack. He screamed in pain. I quickly let go and covered my ears. &ldquo;Don&#39;t do that!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;You broke my arm!&rdquo; He held his arm in the other.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;That was your fault and stop yelling!&rdquo; I was annoyed. I started running toward the control center again.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Wait, not that way!&rdquo; He called out.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;What is it now?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Our troops are losing the battle down there. There&#39;s another way out of here isn&#39;t there?&rdquo; He asked.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Of course there is.&rdquo; I gave him a stupid look, &ldquo;Throw me your gun.&rdquo; I commanded.</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;What? Why?&rdquo; He asked.
			</p>
			<p>&ldquo;So I can help you idiots.&rdquo; He paused then handed it to me. I wasn&#39;t familiar with the model since it&#39;s been a number of years, but it looked like a machine gun. &ldquo;How many bullets are left?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;There should be about twelve in there.&rdquo; He answered.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;About or are?&rdquo; I said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Twelve.&rdquo; He shook his head.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Throw me a knife.&rdquo; He passed me his switch blade. He followed me down the hall until we reached the exit. There was a lot of gunfire and yelling. I had already learned to control my senses enough to stand the gunfire. A few of the soldiers by the exit had noticed us, but were still focusing on the battle. &ldquo;I hope they&#39;re wearing the same uniform as you or else I might kill them.&rdquo; I said launching myself into the fight.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Hey wait!&rdquo; The soldier called after me, but I already made up my mind. I ran right out and shot the soldiers on the opposite side on sight. I counted eighteen live enemy soldiers. I pulled the trigger and let loose a volley of bullets, re-aiming in the fraction of a second that I had between the shots as I dodged the incoming bullets. I missed once, but the other soldiers helped and managed to shoot six of the other targets. I threw the empty gun at the last soldier as I dashed toward him. I stabbed him in the neck as I dodged the final bullet.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I win.&rdquo; I said as I put down the blade. &ldquo;So, how long has it been since I was awake?&rdquo; I asked. Only one person stepped forward. He was older than the others and seemed to be more confident.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;You&#39;ve been asleep for 30 years.&rdquo; He answered.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I was supposed to be asleep for 50, what happened?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The virus has gotten out of hand. Back in your time there were a bit over nine billion people and we had a surplus of humans. Then that virus came and-,&rdquo; He started explaining.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;And destroyed 43% the world&#39;s population in just a year, yeah I know all that. I went to sleep back in 2054. I have eidetic memory so I don&#39;t forget anything. It was part of the plan just in case the others lost their memory. What&#39;s the real reason you woke us up?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Two years after you left, there was a second strain of the virus transmitted by any bodily fluid. It made the destruction even faster. We have less than 900 thousand people left. That&#39;s less than .01% left.&rdquo; He answered.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Interesting, but he planned for something like this.&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&#39;m tired, get me back to your base and we&#39;ll talk some more. I want to rendezvous with the others soon.&rdquo; I walked out with them.
