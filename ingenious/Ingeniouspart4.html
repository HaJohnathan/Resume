			    &ldquo;How classified was our location?&rdquo; I asked Trist.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Only captains and above know about it&rdquo; She answered.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Show me everyone with a captain rank and above.&rdquo; I ordered a man working at a computer. &ldquo;Now filter it to people who have gone missing or are dead.&rdquo; There
			    was still a large amount of people on the list. &ldquo;Print out a picture of these.&rdquo; I indicated a list of names with my finger. &ldquo;I assume you have prisoners,
			    correct?&rdquo; I turned back to Trist.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Yes, we&#39;ve been torturing them since we captured them, but we haven&#39;t been able to extract any information just yet.&rdquo; Trist answered.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Cease the torture at once, its inhumane and ineffective.&rdquo; I said not showing my disgust.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Governments have been doing it for years. Don&#39;t you idiots ever learn anything?&rdquo; Ene said when he appeared with Rosemary and Zane.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Did you find them?&rdquo; I asked.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;I&#39;ve narrowed it down to four places, as long as they aren&#39;t stupid they should be hiding on the 21<sup>st</sup> island though.&rdquo; Ene said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; I took his list, &ldquo;take me to one of the prisoners now.&rdquo; I ordered Trist.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;This way.&rdquo; Trist led us underground. There were many metal cells and cages with prisoners in each. &ldquo;These are prisoners from when we rescued you.&rdquo; She
			    pointed to several cells.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Okay, give me a minute.&rdquo; I walked into a room with an adult male. &ldquo;Hello sir, I&#39;m here to ask you a few questions.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;You&#39;re Master James.&rdquo; He said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Yes, but that doesn&#39;t matter right now. I&#39;m looking for my friends would you like to help me?&rdquo; I asked.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;I&#39;d like to, but the government here is corrupt. As long as we&#39;re under their supervision I can&#39;t tell you anything.&rdquo; He answered.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;They don&#39;t control us, they never have and they never will.&rdquo; I said with a smirk, &ldquo;Now then, I need to know who your leader is.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;I can&#39;t tell you.&rdquo; He said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;My friends are in your leader&#39;s hands, so I will need to know now.&rdquo; I spread out the pictures of the missing and dead high ranking officers, &ldquo;Now then,
			    which one is it?&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;She&#39;s not here.&rdquo; He looked away slightly. His voice quivered just a bit, nothing normal people would notice. He made slight movements that told me
			    everything I needed to know.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; I packed up all the photos, &ldquo;I&#39;ll be dropping by the 21<sup>st</sup> island, I hope you don&#39;t have anyone important there.&rdquo; I said on my way
			    out. I heard him flinch just slightly. &ldquo;General Noel is their leader and their base is definitely the 21<sup>st</sup> island.&rdquo; I told everyone when I
			    closed the door.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; Trist asked.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Slight eye movement among other body language keys, it&#39;s a pain to explain.&rdquo; I said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Wow, you all have abilities like that?&rdquo; Trist asked.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Wasn&#39;t it recorded in a history book?&rdquo; Rosemary asked.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Well, it&#39;s hard to tell exactly how smart you guys are from just that.&rdquo; Trist answered.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;We all have our own specialties, but we&#39;re all smart.&rdquo; I said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;If only I was half as smart as you guys, life would be so easy.&rdquo; Trist said with a smile not knowing what kind of weight it had.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo; Ene said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;What?&rdquo; Trist asked as if she didn&#39;t hear him
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;I said shut up you ignorant idiot!&rdquo; Ene turned around and started walking away. &ldquo;I&#39;m going to work on some stuff, tell me when we leave.&rdquo; He called back.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;I really don&#39;t care for his attitude.&rdquo; Trist said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;You really shouldn&#39;t talk about things you don&#39;t understand though.&rdquo; Zane said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Let&#39;s go.&rdquo; Rosemary sighed. &ldquo;My head&#39;s starting to hurt.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Mine too.&rdquo; Zane and Rosemary left.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;What&#39;s their problems?&rdquo; Trist asked.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Let&#39;s get back to the lounge, I&#39;ll explain there.&rdquo; I sighed. The two of us sat across from each other on the couch.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;So are you going to tell me now?&rdquo; Trist asked.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;All life is equal. No life is unfair because it is equally unfair to us all. It&#39;s something we used to say.&rdquo; I said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&rdquo; She asked.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Exactly what it sounds like, none of us believe that life is unfair to us because we understood that everyone had their own troubles. We are the smartest
			    people in the world, but unlike what most people would have you think, it causes a lot of problems. I won&#39;t tell you about the others since this is very
			    personal information, but I&#39;ll tell you a bit about myself. Ever since I was young I could always tell what people were thinking. My parents didn&#39;t know
			    what to do with me and I could tell that they didn&#39;t like each other all that much. Both of them had affairs that neither knew about. So that wrecked my
			    home life. I couldn&#39;t make any friends because I always knew what people were thinking. Everyone&#39;s thoughts are just so mean and no one really wants a
			    person who can basically read their mind.&rdquo; I told her. &ldquo;Our abilities do allow us to do extraordinary things, but it caused a lot of problems for us during
			    our normal life.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;I guess I should apologize to everyone then.&rdquo; Trist said with regret.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;R and Z know you didn&#39;t mean it. It may have hurt their feelings a bit, but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll understand. As for E, he doesn&#39;t care. He claims he doesn&#39;t
			    have emotions and apologies are stupid, but what isn&#39;t according to him.&rdquo; I explained. &ldquo;We should go soon. To the 21<sup>st</sup> island I mean.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;I&#39;ll call for back-up immediately, give me a few days.&rdquo; Trist said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;No, we&#39;ll be going in today and we won&#39;t need any back-up. For the most part, we&#39;ll be going in alone.&rdquo; I said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;I am a colonel and I have broken several rules already. I can&#39;t make any more exceptions, even for someone like you.&rdquo; Trist said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;You&#39;re going to have to, just one more time.&rdquo; I said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo; Trist put her hands to her head and leaned down, &ldquo;fine.&rdquo; She sighed.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;We&#39;re also going to need some weapons.&rdquo; I said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Trist said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;We&#39;ll be going tonight, so get ready.&rdquo; I stood up.
