			    Airi timidly pulled the trigger of her gun as she blindly shot to her target. Ishiza went crazy with her gun and was trying to shoot all the targets as she
			    laughed. Noda was taking a nap after she made her first shot, which was right on target. &ldquo;Just how fast am I?&rdquo; I asked myself as I pointed a handgun
			    towards the target. I moved my hand out to the right then swung it past the target. I watched the bullet curve into the center of the target.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;I didn&#39;t know we could do that.&rdquo; Rosemary said as she curved a bullet into another target, &ldquo;Come on, let&#39;s go get your sister and crazy girlfriend.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;I have a girlfriend?&rdquo; I asked.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Wow, you don&#39;t even remember?&rdquo; Rosemary said as she and Zane laughed.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;I still don&#39;t remember anything.&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Which one is my girlfriend?&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;You&#39;ll figure it out soon enough.&rdquo; Rosemary was still laughing.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;The sooner we all meet up the better, right?&rdquo; Zane smiled. We all walked to meet up with Trist and James.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;I told you already you can&#39;t separate R and Z.&rdquo; James complained.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Well if there are only 11 of us it&#39;ll make it very hard to cover a large area.&rdquo; Trist complained, &ldquo;We need to split them up.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;It&#39;s extremely ineffective. You don&#39;t know what happens when they&#39;re apart. E will definitely want to go in through the front. He&#39;ll provide a good
			    distraction. R and Z are going in through the back, while the rest of us will infiltrate through the roof.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;How are we going to get on the roof? Rockets make too much noise.&rdquo; Trist said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Don&#39;t you have some kind of stealth hover technology?&rdquo; James asked.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;No, we&#39;ve been focused on military weaponry and we didn&#39;t really have a use for stealth since our opponents are mindless.&rdquo; Trist said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;And you guys still stupid.&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&#39;ve looked at your weapons, you&#39;ve haven&#39;t made much progress since my time.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;You can use our noise to cover your rockets.&rdquo; Zane said. &ldquo;They&#39;ll see us coming though; the monorail&#39;s the only way in so I&#39;m sure they have a lot of
			    guards there.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Don&#39;t worry about it. I have plan.&rdquo; I said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;I thought you would.&rdquo; James smiled.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Let&#39;s get on with it.&rdquo; I said. We departed with a handful of soldiers. The monorail took us across the separated islands, between them were large gaps.
			    The ground was several kilometers below. &ldquo;Afraid of trains, or of heights?&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Heights.&rdquo; I thought Zane looked nervous.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;We&#39;re already on the train, worrying about it now won&#39;t change that fact.&rdquo; I said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;I know you&#39;ve told me that before, I just can&#39;t help it.&rdquo; Zane answered.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Just be like Noda and take a nap.&rdquo; I said looking down at her. She was lying down with her head next to my hand taking up the most of the bench. Everyone
			    except Airi and Ishiza, who were looking out the window playing some kind of game, glanced at each other quickly. &ldquo;Something wrong?&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;No, we&#39;re getting close though.&rdquo; James said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Hoods down guys.&rdquo; I chuckled. &ldquo;Noda wake up. Airi, Ishiza sit down.&rdquo; I commanded.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Are you even sure this is going to work?&rdquo; Trist sounded concerned.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;I saw it on a game once, it&#39;ll work.&rdquo; I answered.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;We&#39;re screwed.&rdquo; Trist said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Don&#39;t worry, this should work.&rdquo; Rosemary smiled as she put her hood down. Three rebel soldiers walked onto the train from each of the four doors. Each of
			    us were wearing large brown cloaks that you would see in anime. The brown cloaks were to conceal the large assault rifles that each of us had. I was having
			    Trist hold onto mine for now so I could move freely for now.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Alright everyone, hands up.&rdquo; One man said after seeing that everyone had their hoods up.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;How about you try and make me.&rdquo; I said softly and chuckled.
			</p>
			<p>
			    I heard the man grunt and walk forward taking my bait like an idiot, although it didn&#39;t matter at all to me. &ldquo;You insolent little-,&rdquo; He started to yell
			    pointing his gun towards my head.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Slow it down,&rdquo; I said to myself trying to control my abilities. It is hard to control the abilities that I have gained.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;piece of-,&rdquo; He was about to lift my hood with the end of his barrel.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Make it stop!&rdquo; I yelled kicking out his feet from under him. I grabbed the two guns in my pockets and whacked him in the head. Something snapped in me and
			    I started to laugh. The three behind me started shooting. The normal ADHD was gone and I was completely focused. Several shots were fired in what seemed to
			    me like slow motion. In human terms, the bullets seemed to move as if they were pebbles being thrown and as such I cocked my head, barely dodging every
			    bullet. I moved quickly across the train and knocked them out with a few quick hits. Rosemary and James took out the others behind me. &ldquo;What a bunch of
			    idiots!&rdquo; I laughed.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Get a hold of yourself Ene!&rdquo; James yelled snapping me back to normal.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Sorry about that.&rdquo; I said standing back up.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;What was that? That was,&rdquo; Trist paused, &ldquo;scary. I never actually thought of you I that way.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Yeah whatever.&rdquo; I answered.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;He&#39;s a bit sadistic. We can&#39;t let him stay like that too long or, things happen.&rdquo; James said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Come on, we&#39;ll be doing this quickly.&rdquo; Rosemary said. We waited until the train hit the next station. Lucky for us, these trains are sealed so no one can
			    tell what had happened inside this car. We moved to where the rebels were staying. It was a large run-down apartment building that had many guards.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Everyone know the plan?&rdquo; Trist said to her men and us.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Of course, but I didn&#39;t tell you guys all of it. I gave you the shortened version.&rdquo; I said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Sorry to say, but you wouldn&#39;t be able to memorize all the information like we can.&rdquo; Zane said. &ldquo;Don&#39;t worry, you know everything you need to, just follow
			    it exactly and you&#39;ll all be fine. Let&#39;s move out.&rdquo; On that command each of us moved to our predesignated positions.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Just what is the password?&rdquo; I sighed to myself. I held out my phone that I had charged earlier. The phone was locked by a password, but there was neither
			    a way of figuring out what characters were being used nor how many there were.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;I&#39;m getting sort of hungry.&rdquo; Zane was speaking on the communication headset we passed out earlier.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Come to think of it we haven&#39;t eaten yet.&rdquo; Rosemary said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;We have enhanced homeostasis. We don&#39;t need to eat often anymore, although, some of us barely ate anyway.&rdquo; James mumbled the last part.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Why are you guys speaking on the coms?&rdquo; I asked.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Oh right, everyone in position?&rdquo; Zane said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;We&#39;re all good on our end.&rdquo; Trist answered.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;I&#39;m ready too.&rdquo; James said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Then we&#39;ll move on your command, Ene.&rdquo; Zane said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Good.&rdquo; I smiled and shoved my phone in my pocket.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;This is a restricted area! Put your hands up now!&rdquo; Two guards yelled when I walked into view.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;I have a gift.&rdquo; I smiled and pulled the pin as I swung the grenade at the entrance. Before it could explode I incapacitated both the guards and kicked
			    them out of the way.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Look at that it went boom!&rdquo; Ishiza held herself and laughed, &ldquo;Oh can&#39;t we just kill them and have a blood shower!&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;That&#39;s not good, blood&#39;s kind of nasty.&rdquo; Airi said in a meek voice.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Whatever, just don&#39;t make so much noise.&rdquo; Noda complained as she leaned against a rail.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Ok, James said someone I know should be coming soon.&rdquo; I said to myself. I could hear thousands of footsteps running around in the building, mostly
			    disorderly. I could also hear the steps of James, Rosemary, Zane, Trist, and her troop running around inside. There was also something else. Someone was
			    running straight for the window above me. The glass shattered as a girl crashed right through it. I jumped out of her way before she could land. Her punch
			    broke the bridge we were standing on. The two of us fell onto the ground below. The dust floating everywhere didn&#39;t stop her from attacking me. She was
			    faster and stronger than any human. She had to be the person I was supposed to know, but the dust didn&#39;t give me a chance to get a good look.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The girl launched herself toward me swinging her right hand. She was fast, but I was able to move out of the way just in time. I turned around and moved
			    back just a bit. The girl turned around just as fast and started attacking me again. She was fast and didn&#39;t leave an opening for me after dodging. I
			    pulled back for a moment to gain some time. She threw another jab, but instead of moving back to dodge like normal I grabbed her arm and pulled her in.
			    Just as I was about to punch her in the stomach she did something unexpected. She quickly twisted her arm and moved to the side as she tripped me and used
			    her right hand to punch me into the ground.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Come now, you didn&#39;t actually expect that to work.&rdquo; The girl spoke with a grin. &ldquo;I had to break my arm, but you really should&#39;ve seen it coming.&rdquo; She
			    twisted her left arm back to normal. The dust finally cleared up to reveal her face.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Kari?&rdquo; I said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Yeah? What&#39;s with that stupid look on your face? Oh, you don&#39;t remember, do you? What an idiot.&rdquo; She laughed as she leaned down and kissed me. I tried to
			    move away a bit, but she had me pinned down.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; I asked when she finally stopped.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Just because you don&#39;t remember doesn&#39;t mean that I&#39;m not your girlfriend anymore.&rdquo; She laughed.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;You&#39;re my girlfriend?&rdquo; I laughed, &ldquo;Right, the crazy one.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;I&#39;m not crazy, but you&#39;re still an idiot.&rdquo; She hit me on the head.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;You broke my nose.&rdquo; I complained.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;It&#39;ll heal you idiot.&rdquo; She answered. &ldquo;Looks like they&#39;re having fun in there.&rdquo; We looked at the building as explosions went off.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;Let&#39;s go stop it now.&rdquo; I said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    &ldquo;I guess I should expect nothing less from plan made by J.&rdquo; She helped me up. &ldquo;Time to get to work.&rdquo;
